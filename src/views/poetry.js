      <p> I wanted to write a haiku \n
          And one without Brenna, too \n
          I was ready to write \n
          A Brenna-less plight \n
          When I realized, it's not true
      </p>
      <p> No thesis heads my paper \n
          Transitions aren't the norm \n
          Stands as a guide to how sentences deform \n
          While Balog breaks out fire, I remain at ease \n
          For it's Mrs. Delano I need to please
      </p>
      <p> When one thought his mind opaque \n
          Was recently downed in a lake \n
          He asked for a sign \n
          from one so divine \n
          All she needed was one word â€” fake
      </p>
      <p> A foolish Berktan once thought \n
          Brenna's divinity for naught \n
          My friends in the 'hood \n
          Thought it would be rude \n
          For him to not be retaught
      </p>
