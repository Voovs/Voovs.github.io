# Vue without Vue Cli
Among other mini-experiments here, this site is built without Vue Cli, while still using the Vue.js framework

### Coming soon
- An actually functioning site (first commit was just for handoffs between computers)
- A word counter, pulling on my previous work at [NestedNotes](https://nestednotes.netlify.com)
- Some sort of really simple, yet effective colour scheme creator. All the ones online have too many ads, are unnecessarily complex, or don't have enough functionality
- Essentially a virtural closet? Not sure exactly what this'll end up being, yet it should allow you to better orginze what outfits you have
- The typing speed test. Only one has so far satisfied me, [created by Ching Chang](https://chingchang.dev/projects/typing-speed-test). While his is certainly capable, I'd like to add some competition to the market, while addressing some issues with Mr.Chang's
